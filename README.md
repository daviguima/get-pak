### Setup
⚠️ GDAL is a requirement for the installation, therefore, 
usage of a conda environment 
([Anaconda.org](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)) 
is strongly recommended. Unless you know what you are doing (-:

## Installation
Create a Conda environment (python versions above 3.9 were not tested but they should also be compatible):
```
conda create --name getpak python=3.9
```
Activate your conda env:
```
conda activate getpak
```
With your conda env activated, install GDAL before installing `getpak` to avoid dependecy errors:
```
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
```
Clone `getpak` repo to the desired location, enter it and type:
```
pip install -e .
```
(Setup in edit mode is strongly recommended until a valid stable release is added to the Python Package Index - PyPI).
